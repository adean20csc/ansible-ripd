#### Create a RancherOS virtual machine template with Packer

Running in a docker container ;-)

To automatically provision an Docker image containing all the necessary components to run Ansible.

If your SSH key does not work add
```
rancher.password=your-password-here
```
to the end of the linux line in grub
