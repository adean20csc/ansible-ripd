#### Requirements

- Linux with KVM module enabled.  
  **Note**: This can be a virtual machine with virtualization extensions passed through to the guest.

Since this project requires considerable amount of dependencies we currently require the use of a container.  Using Docker and docker-compose eases the requirements.  Use the most current version available of both Docker and docker-compose.  The links below describe how to install each requirement.
